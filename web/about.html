<p>Sinhalese is the native language of Sinhalese people. According to the population census
    of 2007 16 millions of people use this language. Sinhalese is also spoken as a second language by other ethnic
    groups in Sri Lanka. So there are more than 20 millions of people who speak and use Sinhalese. Sinhalese is also
    called as Sinhala.</p>

<p>Sinhala WordNet is a lexical database for Sinhala language. There are hundred thousands of words in usage. They can
    be categorized into nouns, verbs, adverbs, adjectives and etc. So these words can be used in different ways. People
    who live in different areas of Sri Lanka have different usage patterns. So each word may have different meanings
    when using them. People should know these synonyms when using the language. After implementing this Sinhala WordNet
    application people will be able to find out the usage of words with sentences which related to words. If anybody
    have a doubt how to use any word in a sentence he or she can find sentences suggestions in WordNet application.</p>

<p>According to Department of Census and Statistics, they conducted a pilot study to assess the computer literacy of
    household population in the group of 5 – 69 years of Sri Lanka as well as to find out to what extent they use
    computers for various activities including use of e-mail and internet facilities. Availability of home computers,
    e-mail and internet facilities etc in the households were also assessed by this study. This study was conducted as a
    household survey. Household members in the age group of 5 – 69 years of scientifically selected 11,500 households
    covering all districts other than Mulativu and Kilinochchi were interviewed.</p>

<P>Sri Lanka is still a developing country. So Sri Lanka is still not a fully-fledged computer user. But according to
    the survey reports computer literacy is not weak. It is in a good position. Most of young people of Sri Lanka have
    computers or mobile devices. The highest computer literacy rate of 20 percent was reported from the Colombo
    district. Over 10 percent literacy rates were reported from Gampaha, Kalutara, Kandy and Matara districts. The
    Monaragala district reported the lowest computer literacy rate of 3 percent. So introducing Sinhala WordNet will be
    so much effective.</P>
